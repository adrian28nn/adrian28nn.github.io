    video games have always been a huge part of my life, shaping my interests and how i see the world. they're not just games to me, they're fully immersive experiences that let me step into another reality, and i love taking the time to soak it all in.
    <br><br>
    besides gaming, i have a strong interest in photography and cinematography, and bringing these together eventually led me to virtual photography. it's a way to capture beautiful and cinematic moments from the games i love, and to create my own stories through each shot. it's how i show these games through my own perspective and style.
    <br><br>
    so here i am, sharing my journey with you. the virtual photography community is amazing, and i love contributing to it. i also hope to help people discover what can be created with just a game and a bit of creativity. i'm still new to it though, so i'm always seeking inspiration and ways to improve, creating shots that feel more and more satisfying for me and hopefully catch more eyes.
    <br><br>
    in the future, i plan to use this site for more than just virtual photography. i want it to be a cozy, relaxed space where i can share my projects in any form they take. the site itself has been as much of an experiment as my other projects and hobbies.

    i've always been fascinated by the art of filmmaking and have spent a lot of time studying and exploring cinematography, understanding how visuals and storytelling come together to create something unforgettable.
    <br><br>
    this has given me a deeper appreciation when watching movies and has also helped me develop a better way of discovering new films to enjoy.
    <br><br>
    if you're curious about what i watch, you can check out <a href="https://letterboxd.com/Adrian28/">my Letterboxd profile</a>, where i keep track of all my movies!

   <!-- music -->
   <div id="music" style="display: none;">
        <p>music is more than just something i enjoy - it's an experience. sometimes it feels like stepping into another world, crafted by my favorite songs, where melodies and lyrics come together and hit me in such a unique way. it's not just about listening, it's about feeling, like the music knows me, and i know it.
            <br><br>
            there's something powerful about the way a song can resonate so deeply, transporting me, calming me, or stirring emotions i didn't know were there. sometimes it even helps me with my tourette's (the more you know), quieting everything else for a little while. music isn't just sound to me, it's a really important part of who i am, and i know it might sound exaggerated or "generic," but that's truly how i feel about it.
            <br><br>
            besides that, it's a really good way to connect with someone else. knowing i have people and friends with whom i can share my songs and discovering they also really resonate with and enjoy them is like food for my soul. it helps me bond with people in a way that feels special.
            <br><br>
            over the past years, i've come across many songs that i've fallen in love with. for my most recent ones, i started creating some Spotify playlists that I love to share with anyone. i mostly enjoy listening to and discovering songs from any era or genre (with a few exceptions, of course, that i don't resonate with), but my main genres are Metal and Electronic.
            <br><br>
            one playlist i built with love recently is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ytOVKZZukEdri73V1M2X0?si=847875c7222f4b67">Let Me Rust</a>, containing hand-picked alternative metal songs that i discovered and that hit me really hard. i also have lots of other personal playlists on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/adriannn28?si=3a5a45624c904bf8">my Spotify profile</a>, so feel free to explore.
